# BookARide NZ — Agent Instructions

**READ THIS ENTIRE FILE BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES.**
**EVERY rule here exists because a previous agent broke production by ignoring it.**

---

## LOCKED DECISIONS — DO NOT CHANGE, REVERT, OR "IMPROVE"

These decisions are FINAL. Do not introduce alternatives, fallbacks, or "improvements".

### 1. Database: Neon PostgreSQL ONLY

We migrated FROM MongoDB TO Neon PostgreSQL. This is DONE. Do not touch it.

- Connection: `DATABASE_URL` env var (Neon PostgreSQL connection string)
- Compatibility layer: `backend/database.py` (NeonDatabase class — mimics Motor API over PostgreSQL JSONB)
- Schema: `backend/schema.sql`
- **NEVER** add `motor`, `pymongo`, `MongoClient`, or any MongoDB driver
- **NEVER** reference `MONGO_URL`, `DB_NAME`, or `mongodb://` anything
- **NEVER** fall back to `mongodb://localhost:27017`
- **NEVER** add a "MongoDB fallback" or "MongoDB option"

### 2. Email: Mailgun ONLY

We use Mailgun. Not SendGrid. Not SMTP. Not Gmail. Not "a fallback".

- Config: `MAILGUN_API_KEY` + `MAILGUN_DOMAIN` env vars
- Sender module: `backend/email_sender.py` (Mailgun HTTP API only)
- **NEVER** add SendGrid, `smtplib`, `MIMEMultipart`, `MIMEText`, or SMTP code
- **NEVER** add `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`, `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT` env vars
- **NEVER** add "email fallback" logic — if Mailgun fails, log the error, that's it

### 3. Helmet: react-helmet-async (official)

- **NEVER** use `@vuer-ai/react-helmet-async` — it's a broken fork

### 4. Frontend: CRA + CRACO (NOT Vite, NOT Next.js)

- Build: `craco build` (NOT `react-scripts build`)
- The `@` alias is configured in `craco.config.js` → resolves to `src/`
- **NEVER** migrate to Vite or Next.js unless explicitly asked

### 5. No Facebook Integration

- Facebook integration was removed (caused production crashes)
- **NEVER** re-add FacebookTab or Facebook API routes
- **NEVER** add `FACEBOOK_APP_ID`, `FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET` references

### 7. No Shared Shuttle Service

The shared shuttle service has been completely removed from the admin system and codebase.

- **NEVER** re-add the shuttle tab to AdminDashboard
- **NEVER** re-add `SharedShuttle.jsx` or `ShuttleDriverPortal.jsx`
- **NEVER** re-add shuttle API endpoints (`/api/shuttle/*`)
- Backend shuttle endpoints and pricing code have been removed from `server.py`
- Note: "airport-shuttle" as a `serviceType` for regular bookings is STILL VALID — that's the core private transfer service, not the shared shuttle

### 8. Customer Confirmation Design — LOCKED

The customer confirmation email design is FINAL and must not change:

- Payment method "stripe" displays as "Credit/Debit Card" (never show "Stripe" to customers)
- Payment status shows as green "PAID" badge when payment_status == 'paid'
- PaymentSuccess.jsx shows "Payment Successful!" with booking details — no Stripe branding
- **NEVER** show "Stripe" text in customer-facing emails or pages
- **NEVER** change the confirmation email layout/design without explicit permission

### 6. Maps & Distance: Google Maps API ONLY (No Geoapify)

We use Google Maps for distance calculation, directions, and autocomplete. Geoapify has been removed.

- Distance: `_get_distance_google()` in `backend/server.py` (Distance Matrix + Directions API)
- Config: `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` env var
- **NEVER** add Geoapify API calls, `GEOAPIFY_API_KEY`, or `geoapify.com` references
- **NEVER** add Geoapify as a "fallback" for Google Maps
- **NEVER** use Geoapify for address autocomplete or distance calculation

## PRE-CHANGE CHECKLIST

Before making ANY change, verify:

1. Does my change introduce MongoDB, Motor, or pymongo? **STOP.**
2. Does my change introduce SendGrid, SMTP, or smtplib? **STOP.**
3. Does my change introduce Geoapify or `GEOAPIFY_API_KEY`? **STOP.**
4. Does my change add a new import? **Verify the component/module exists first.**
5. Does my change remove or modify an existing import? **Verify nothing else uses it.**
6. Am I adding a new JSX component usage? **Add the import statement too.**
7. Does my build pass with `cd frontend && npm run build`? **Test before committing.**

## Hosting

- Frontend: **Vercel** (React 18, CRA + CRACO)
- Backend: **Render** (FastAPI/Uvicorn, Python 3.11+)

## Backend Architecture

- Main server: `backend/server.py` (~14,000 lines, monolithic)
- Database layer: `backend/database.py` — NeonDatabase class that translates
  MongoDB-style queries (find_one, update_one, etc.) to PostgreSQL JSONB operations
- The `db` global is initialized in the startup event from `DATABASE_URL`
- Route files: `backend/routes_*.py` (bulk, customers, drivers, vehicles, analytics, settings, templates)

## Environment Variables (Render)

**All credentials are configured in Render's Environment tab — NOT in a `.env` file in the repo.**
The absence of a `.env` file does NOT mean credentials are missing. Do NOT assume services are unconfigured.
See `backend/.env.example` for the full list of variables (template only — no real secrets).

Required (all set in Render):
- `DATABASE_URL` — Neon PostgreSQL connection string
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY`
- `MAILGUN_API_KEY` + `MAILGUN_DOMAIN`

Optional (but needed for full functionality, all set in Render):
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` + `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` + `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` + `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`
- `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` + `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` (OAuth)
- `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` (Calendar + Search Console)

## Build & Test

```bash
# Frontend build (MUST use npm run build, not react-scripts directly)
cd frontend && npm run build

# Backend start
cd backend && python3 start.py
```

## Booking System Architecture

### Booking Flow (Customer → Admin)

1. Customer submits booking via `BookNow.jsx` → `POST /api/bookings` → creates booking in `db.bookings`
2. If within 24 hours: status = `pending_approval` (requires admin manual approval)
3. If Stripe payment: `POST /api/payment/create-checkout` → Stripe → webhook updates booking to `paid`/`confirmed`
4. Admin sees ALL bookings at `GET /api/bookings` (fetches from `db.bookings` ONLY)

### Orphan Payment Recovery

If a customer pays via Stripe but the booking is missing from admin:
- `GET /api/bookings/orphan-payments` — lists paid Stripe transactions with no matching booking
- `POST /api/bookings/recover-from-payment` — creates a booking from the payment data
- The admin dashboard has a "Check Orphan Payments" button for this

### Known Booking System Issues (Fixed 2026-03-11)

- Pydantic `Booking(**b)` validation was silently dropping bookings with missing/invalid fields
- Shuttle bookings were being merged into admin panel causing confusion
- SMTP code existed in `routes_bulk.py` violating Mailgun-only rule
- Orphaned `validate_booking_date` function at module level (not inside any class)

### Known Booking System Issues (Fixed 2026-03-18)

- `insert_many()` was missing from `database.py` — backup restore would crash with AttributeError
- Stripe webhook did not verify `matched_count` after updating booking — payment could succeed but booking status not update
- iCloud contact sync was not triggered after Stripe payment webhook — only on initial booking creation
- Shared shuttle service tab/code removed from admin dashboard (was cluttering the admin panel)
- ALL delete/archive/restore operations now verify backup insert + find_one before deleting source record
- Bulk delete only removes bookings that were successfully backed up (per-record verification)
- Orphan payment recovery now verifies the recovered booking was actually created

### ZERO BOOKING LOSS RULES — MANDATORY

**A booking must NEVER be lost. These rules are absolute and non-negotiable.**

#### Rule 1: NEVER delete without verified backup

Before deleting a booking from ANY collection, the backup/destination insert MUST be:
1. Verified with `result.acknowledged == True`
2. Double-checked with `find_one()` to confirm the record exists in the destination
3. Only THEN can the source record be deleted

This applies to ALL move operations:
- `delete_booking()` → must verify `deleted_bookings.insert_one()` before `bookings.delete_one()`
- `archive_booking()` → must verify `bookings_archive.insert_one()` before `bookings.delete_one()`
- `restore_booking()` → must verify `bookings.insert_one()` before `deleted_bookings.delete_one()`
- `unarchive_booking()` → must verify `bookings.insert_one()` before `bookings_archive.delete_one()`
- Bulk versions of all the above follow the same pattern per-record

**If the backup/verify fails, ABORT the delete and raise an error. The booking stays where it is.**

#### Rule 2: NEVER silently drop bookings on read

- `GET /api/bookings` uses `model_construct()` (not `Booking(**b)`) to skip validators
- Three-tier fallback ensures every record is returned even if fields are missing/invalid
- **NEVER** switch back to `Booking(**b)` for reading — it silently drops records with missing fields

#### Rule 3: VERIFY all critical inserts

After inserting a booking (creation, recovery, import), verify with `find_one()`:
- `POST /api/bookings` — already has double-check
- `POST /api/bookings/recover-from-payment` — verified after insert
- Import/CSV endpoints — must verify each insert

#### Rule 4: After payment confirmation, trigger ALL 4 actions

Every payment confirmation path (webhook, polling, manual) must call:
1. `send_customer_confirmation(booking)` — email/SMS
2. `send_booking_notification_to_admin(booking)` — admin alert
3. `create_calendar_event(booking)` — Google Calendar
4. `add_contact_to_icloud(booking)` — iCloud contacts (deduped)

#### Rule 5: Log CRITICAL on any booking write failure

Any failed booking database operation must log with `logger.error(f"CRITICAL: ...")` so it can be monitored. Never swallow booking errors silently.

#### Rule 6: Booking collections are sacred

There are 3 booking collections. A booking must ALWAYS exist in exactly one of them:
- `db.bookings` — active bookings (shown in admin dashboard)
- `db.deleted_bookings` — soft-deleted bookings (recoverable)
- `db.bookings_archive` — archived completed bookings (7-year retention)

**NEVER** delete a booking from all three. **NEVER** have a code path where a booking exists in zero collections.

## QUALITY STANDARDS — STRICT, NON-NEGOTIABLE

This is a real business serving real customers. Every feature must work. No fake functionality, no misleading promises.

### 1. No Mock/Fake Functionality

- **NEVER** add console.log-only form submissions — every form MUST submit to a real backend endpoint
- **NEVER** show success toasts for operations that didn't actually succeed
- **NEVER** add placeholder handlers like "will be connected later" — connect it NOW or don't ship it
- Every button, form, and link must do what it says. If it says "Send Message", it must send the message.

### 2. No Misleading Claims

- **NEVER** claim "24/7 Support" unless there is an actual 24/7 support system (chat, phone, ticketing)
- "24/7 Service" (shuttle availability) is accurate and allowed — the service does run 24/7
- **NEVER** add testimonials, review counts, or statistics that aren't real
- **NEVER** show features as available when they aren't implemented

### 3. Customer-Facing Text Standards

- **NEVER** show technical terms to customers ("Stripe", "webhook", "API", database field names)
- Payment method "stripe" displays as "Credit/Debit Card" — ALWAYS
- Error messages must be helpful and human-readable, never stack traces or technical errors
- All customer emails must be professional, properly formatted, and contain accurate information

### 4. Every Payment Path Must Be Complete

ALL payment confirmation paths (Stripe webhook, Afterpay capture, polling, manual sync, SMS approval) MUST trigger all 4 post-payment actions:
1. `send_customer_confirmation(booking)`
2. `send_booking_notification_to_admin(booking)`
3. `create_calendar_event(booking)`
4. `add_contact_to_icloud(booking)`

No exceptions. If you add a new payment path, it must include all 4.

### 5. Webhook Idempotency Required

- Stripe webhooks can be retried — check if already processed before sending duplicate confirmations
- Check `payment_status == 'paid'` before triggering post-payment actions on repeat webhooks

### 6. Bulk Operations Must Be Safe

- Bulk delete/archive/restore MUST verify each record individually (per-record backup + find_one verification)
- **NEVER** use `delete_many()` after a batch `insert_one()` loop without per-record verification
- If any single record fails backup, skip it and continue — never delete unverified records

### 7. Field Name Consistency

- Payment status field: always `payment_status` (snake_case), NEVER `paymentStatus` (camelCase)
- Payment method field: always `payment_method` (snake_case) in database writes
- Be consistent — check existing field names before adding new update operations

### 8. Build Must Pass

- `cd frontend && npm run build` must succeed with zero errors before committing
- Fix unused imports, missing imports, and type errors immediately
- Never commit code that doesn't compile
